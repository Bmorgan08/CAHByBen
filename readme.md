# CAHByBen
This is a passion project of mine that I created after my friend and I got bored with the limited range of cards on pretend you're xyzzy. The main goal was to create a new open-source CAH clone for the web that would have blank cards as a possibility.

## Setup 
To set this up on your own machine, you must:
1. Clone the repository
2. Setup correct URLs in the socket manager
3. run "node Websocket.js && node FrontendServer.js" 
4. Forward ports 4040 and 3000. The URL port 4040 is forwarded to. Is the URL that the socket manager connects to.
5. Give the URL to your friends and enjoy

### Small issues
This site only renders correctly on screens bigger than an ipad so you cannot play on mobile, sadly

### Licensing 
This project has no liscense however, many modules used do have liscensing so be careful not to go against these licenses and to know what you are doing

### Fine print
Since this is a passion project, there is no guarantee it will work. And by utilising this software, you understand you are at possible risk for which the authors are not liable.

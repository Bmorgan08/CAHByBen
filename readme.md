#CAHByBen
This is a passion project of mine that i created after me and my friend got bored of the limited range of cards on pretend you're xyzzy. The main goal was to create a new open source CAH clone for the web that would have blank cards as a possibility.

##Setup 
To set this up on your own machine you must:
1. Clone the repository
2. Setup correct URLs in the socket manager
3. run "node Websocket.js && node FrontendServer.js" 
4. Forward ports 4040 and 3000. The URL 4040 is forwarded to should be where the socket manager connects.
5. give the URL to your friends and enjoy

###Small issues
This site only renders correctly on screens bigger than an ipad so you cannot play on mobile sadly

#Liscensing 
This project has no liscense however many modules used do have liscensing so be careful not to go against these liscenses and to know what you are doing

##Fine print
since this is a passion project there is no guarentee it will work. and by utilising this software you understand you are at possible risk for which the authors are not liable.
